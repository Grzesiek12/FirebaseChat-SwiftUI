# FirebaseChat-SwiftUI
Message app in SwiftUI
This app allows to send messages to users based on Firebase base on Firestore.
Log in by entering _@_.com and a password.
Using ImagePicker, we choose our profile picture.
And then using the same data we can log in and send a message to another user saved in Firestore.
